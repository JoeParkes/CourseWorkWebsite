    	<p> Hey! My name is Joe Parkes </p>

    	<p> Welcome to my website which shows my past and current projects as well as sharing an insight into future activities. 
    	
    	<p> I'm studying Computing BSc (Hons) at Coventry University, 
    	exploring a mix of computing skills which will equip me to develop into advanced areas of IT. </p>
    	
    	<p> Originally from Birmingham, I have gained a lot of experience in different fields - from working at Wolverhampton University to helping schools teach ICT. </p>
    	
    	<p> I'm 19 and have a variety of skills to help me progress on this course. I'm passionate about design and have created a range of mock-up apps. Design is something that I love and I am dedicated to ensuring my work is clean, easy to read and fresh. In the past year I have studied both Python and C++ coding. 
    	I'm progressing well in all areas and I feel comfortable with my achievements! </p>
